All tools support 3 formats: session.open, session_open, sessionopen

## Usage Examples

### Login automation
```
"Use workflow.login in 'work' with username 'user@example.com' password 'pass123'"
```

### Data extraction
```
"Use workflow.scrape in 'work' to extract:
- title from 'h1'
- content from '.main'
- links from 'a'"
```

### Form filling
```
"Use workflow.fillForm in 'work' with:
- '#name': 'John'
- '#email': 'john@example.com'"
```

## CLI

```bash
cd szkrabok.playwright.mcp.stealth
bebok session list
bebok session inspect <id>
bebok session delete <id>
bebok cleanup --days 30
```

## Configuration

**Environment variables:**
```bash
HEADLESS=true       # Force headless
TIMEOUT=30000       # Default timeout
DISPLAY=:0          # X server display
VIEWPORT_WIDTH=1920 VIEWPORT_HEIGHT=1080
```

**CLI flags override env:**
```bash
node index.js --headless
node index.js --no-headless
```

**Sessions stored in ./sessions/{id}/:**
- state.json - cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage
- meta.json - timestamps, config, lastUrl

## Playwright test integration

Run standard `.spec.ts` tests against a szkrabok session (pre-authenticated, stealth browser):

```bash
# Standalone
SZKRABOK_SESSION=my-session npx playwright test --config playwright-tests/playwright.config.ts

# With parameters
TEST_URL=https://example.com TEST_TITLE=Example \
  SZKRABOK_SESSION=my-session npx playwright test --config playwright-tests/playwright.config.ts
```

Via MCP:
```json
{"tool": "browser.run_test", "args": {"id": "my-session", "grep": "title", "params": {"url": "https://example.com"}}}
```

Returns: `{passed, failed, skipped, tests: [{title, status, result}]}`

Tests return structured data via `testInfo.attach('result', { body: JSON.stringify(data), contentType: 'application/json' })`.

See [docs/testing.md](./docs/testing.md) for full procedure.

## Architecture

See [docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md) for component map and data flow.

## Internal tests

```bash
cd szkrabok.playwright.mcp.stealth
npm test              # All tests (17 total)
npm run test:node    # Node tests (8)
npm run test:playwright  # Playwright tests (9)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

**Browser not launching:**
```bash
npx playwright install chromium
echo $DISPLAY  # Check display variable
```

**Stealth detection:**
```bash
npm test test/scrap.test.js
```

**Session not persisting:**
```bash
ls -la sessions/
cat sessions/[id]/meta.json
```

**Tools not appearing:**
- Restart MCP client
- Verify config syntax
- Test manually: npm start

### Debug commands
```bash
npm start                    # Test server
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector szkrabok
tail -f logs/szkrabok.log
npm list playwright
```

### User profile

You can run Playwright MCP with persistent profile like a regular browser (default), in isolated contexts for testing sessions, or connect to your existing browser using the browser extension.

**Persistent profile**

All the logged in information will be stored in the persistent profile, you can delete it between sessions if you'd like to clear the offline state.
Persistent profile is located at the following locations and you can override it with the `--user-data-dir` argument.

```bash
# Windows
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\ms-playwright\mcp-{channel}-profile

# macOS
- ~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/mcp-{channel}-profile

# Linux
- ~/.cache/ms-playwright/mcp-{channel}-profile
```

**Isolated**

In the isolated mode, each session is started in the isolated profile. Every time you ask MCP to close the browser,
the session is closed and all the storage state for this session is lost. You can provide initial storage state
to the browser via the config's `contextOptions` or via the `--storage-state` argument. Learn more about the storage
state [here](https://playwright.dev/docs/auth).

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--isolated",
        "--storage-state={path/to/storage.json}"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Browser Extension**

The Playwright MCP Chrome Extension allows you to connect to existing browser tabs and leverage your logged-in sessions and browser state. See [packages/extension/README.md](packages/extension/README.md) for installation and setup instructions.

### Initial state

There are multiple ways to provide the initial state to the browser context or a page.

For the storage state, you can either:
- Start with a user data directory using the `--user-data-dir` argument. This will persist all browser data between the sessions.
- Start with a storage state file using the `--storage-state` argument. This will load cookies and local storage from the file into an isolated browser context.

For the page state, you can use:

- `--init-page` to point to a TypeScript file that will be evaluated on the Playwright page object. This allows you to run arbitrary code to set up the page.

```ts
// init-page.ts
export default async ({ page }) => {
  await page.context().grantPermissions(['geolocation']);
  await page.context().setGeolocation({ latitude: 37.7749, longitude: -122.4194 });
  await page.setViewportSize({ width: 1280, height: 720 });
};
```

- `--init-script` to point to a JavaScript file that will be added as an initialization script. The script will be evaluated in every page before any of the page's scripts.
This is useful for overriding browser APIs or setting up the environment.

```js
// init-script.js
window.isPlaywrightMCP = true;
```

### Configuration file

The Playwright MCP server can be configured using a JSON configuration file. You can specify the configuration file
using the `--config` command line option:

```bash
npx @playwright/mcp@latest --config path/to/config.json
```

### Standalone MCP server

When running headed browser on system w/o display or from worker processes of the IDEs,
run the MCP server from environment with the DISPLAY and pass the `--port` flag to enable HTTP transport.

```bash
npx @playwright/mcp@latest --port 8931
```

And then in MCP client config, set the `url` to the HTTP endpoint:

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8931/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

<details>
<summary><b>Docker</b></summary>

**NOTE:** The Docker implementation only supports headless chromium at the moment.

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "--init", "--pull=always", "mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or If you prefer to run the container as a long-lived service instead of letting the MCP client spawn it, use:

```
docker run -d -i --rm --init --pull=always \
  --entrypoint node \
  --name playwright \
  -p 8931:8931 \
  mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/mcp \
  cli.js --headless --browser chromium --no-sandbox --port 8931 --host 0.0.0.0
```

The server will listen on host port **8931** and can be reached by any MCP client.  

You can build the Docker image yourself.

```
docker build -t mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/mcp .
```

import http from 'http';

import { createConnection } from '@playwright/mcp';
import { SSEServerTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/sse.js';

  // ...

  // Creates a headless Playwright MCP server with SSE transport
  const connection = await createConnection({ browser: { launchOptions: { headless: true } } });
  const transport = new SSEServerTransport('/messages', res);
  await connection.connect(transport);
